    <h1>Prototypal Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Prior lessons have used a simple controller declaration inside the HTML, i.e.
    <code ng-non-bindable>ng-controller='NameOfController'</code>. A better syntax
    format is <em>controller as</em> syntax. Understanding that requires some info
    on <em>prototypal inheritance</em> in JS.</p>
    <p>Prototypal inheritance is based on object instances (rather than classes, which
    is what object oriented inheritance is based on). So the original object instance
    becomes the prototype for all subsequently created objects. If an property of an
    object does not exist, JS traverse the object's <em>prototype chain</em> and searches
    through that object's parents to see if that property can be resolved.
