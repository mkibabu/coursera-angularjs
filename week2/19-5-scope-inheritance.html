    <h1>Controller As Syntax</h1>
    <div>
      <p>It's not common, nor is it good practice, to have one controller handle
        everything on your page. Break it up so that different controllers handle
        different portions. With DOM nesting, some controllers may be nested, and
        Ng has <em>scope inheritance</em> that mimics prototypal inheritance.
        This means that the scope of the outer controller is available to the inner
        controllers. Furthermore, the inner controllers inherit prototypally from
        the outer controller, so properties declared in the outer scope are available
        to the scope of any inner controller, and, on the other hand, can be masked.
      </p>
      <p>From prototypal inheritance, recall that a child may mask the value of a
        parent object by creating a property with the same name as a parent property.
        Similarly, if a child changes (without initially masking) the value of a
        parent property, that value is changed for all children of that parent, since
        JS traverses the prototype chain to find the property,and changes it wherever
        it's found (e.g in some parent), rather than where the change was made (i.e on
        the child).
      </p>
      <p>To avoid this, Ng has a <em>controller as</em> syntax that provides us with a
        convenient object we can use to attach properties to, and not mask or inadvertently
        change them for other sibling controllers. This is done by declaring the Controller
        in HTML as follows:
        <pre ng-non-bindable>
          ng-controller='ControllerName as someAlias'
        </pre>
        The <em>someAlias</em> is attached to the corresponding scope service as a property,
        and points to an object that is an instance of the controller itself. This means
        that the <em>this</em> keyword within the controller function now points to the
        <em>someAlias</em> property within the controller function, and since <em>someAlias</em>
        is an instance of the controller itself, we don't ave to inject the scope anymore.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--
    This parent-child pair doesn't use controller-as syntax, but has prototypal
    inheritance
    -->
    <!-- Uncomment this section for part 4 of lesson 19 -->

    <!-- <div ng-controller='ParentController1'>
      <div ng-controller='ChildController1'>
      </div>
    </div> -->

    <div ng-controller='ParentController2 as parent'>
      Parent value: {{ parent.value }}

      <div ng-controller='ChildController2 as child'>
        Child value: {{ child.value }}<br>
        <!--
        Since the child has access to the parent scope, we can access the parent's
        properties in the child as well.
        -->
        Parent value: {{ parent.value }}
      </div>
    </div>
