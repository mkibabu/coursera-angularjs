      <p>Applications outside our Angular scope that need to affect some Angular
        variable have no access to the digest cycle, and thus cannot be watched to
        see when their changes will affect our Angular changes. For this reason,
        Angular provides the <code>$digest</code> and <code>$apply</code> functions to help
        Angular keep track of changes to its variables caused by ng-external JS.
